## Seller Central

### Inventory Health

- **Days of supply** — How many days will my current stock last at my current sales rate? Which SKUs are running low?
- **Stockout risk** — Which products are at risk of stocking out in the next 7/14/30 days? (Provide your lead time for more accurate results.)
- **Sell-through rate** — Which products are selling well vs. sitting in the warehouse?
- **Inbound pipeline** — What inventory is currently in transit to FBA? How much is being received?
- **Overstocked items** — Which SKUs have more than 90 days of supply and may be incurring excess storage fees?

### Reorder Planning

- **Reorder points** — When should I reorder each SKU? (You'll need to provide your lead time — how long from placing a PO to FBA check-in.)
- **Safety stock** — How much buffer inventory should I keep for each product?
- **Order quantity** — What's the optimal order size to balance ordering costs vs. holding costs? (You'll need to provide your cost per PO.)

> **Note:** Reorder planning requires inputs only you know — lead times, ordering costs, and desired service level. The analyst will ask you for these.

### Fee Analysis

- **FBA fee breakdown** — What are my estimated fees per SKU? Which products have the highest fees?
- **Estimated vs. actual fees** — How do Amazon's estimated fees compare to what I was actually charged in settlements?
- **Fee-to-revenue ratio** — What percentage of my revenue goes to Amazon fees? Which SKUs are barely profitable?
- **Refunds & reimbursements** — How much am I losing to refunds? What has Amazon reimbursed?

### Sales & Traffic

- **Top SKUs by revenue** — What are my best sellers?
- **Daily sales trends** — How are my sales trending over the last 30/60/90 days?
- **Conversion rate by ASIN** — Which products convert well and which don't? Any sudden drops?
- **Buy box health** — Which ASINs have low buy box percentage? What might be causing it?

### Search & Discovery

- **Top search terms** — Which search terms drive the most clicks and conversions for my products?
- **Search query funnel** — Where am I losing customers in the search -> click -> cart -> purchase funnel?
- **Market basket** — What products are frequently bought together with mine? (Cross-sell opportunities.)
- **Repeat purchase rate** — Which products have the most loyal customers?

### Cross-Report Insights

These combine data from multiple reports for deeper analysis:

- **High-converting search terms + low stock** — Products customers are actively finding and buying, but that are running low. Urgent reorder signal.
- **Repeat purchase + stockout risk** — Products with loyal repeat buyers that are at risk of stocking out. Losing a repeat customer is more costly than losing a first-time buyer.
- **Fee burden on top sellers** — Are my best-selling products also my most profitable after fees?
- **Slow movers with high fees** — Products with low sell-through and high fee-to-revenue ratio. Candidates for price adjustment or discontinuation.

### Vendor Sales (`sp_vendor_sales`)

- **Revenue trends** — How is my ordered revenue trending over the last 30/60/90 days? Which ASINs are growing or declining?
- **COGS analysis** — What are my cost of goods sold by ASIN? Which products have the highest COGS relative to revenue?
- **Customer returns** — Which ASINs have the highest return rates? Are returns increasing?

### Vendor Inventory Health (`sp_vendor_inventory`)

- **Sellable on-hand** — How many sellable units does Amazon have on hand for each of my ASINs?
- **Weeks of cover** — Which ASINs have low weeks of cover and may stock out soon?
- **Aged inventory** — Which ASINs have excess or aged inventory sitting in Amazon's warehouses?
- **Open purchase orders** — What purchase order units are outstanding?

### Vendor Traffic (`sp_vendor_traffic`)

- **Glance views** — Which ASINs are getting the most detail page views? Any sudden drops?
- **Buy box percentage** — Which ASINs have low buy box percentage? This affects visibility and sales.

### Vendor Net PPM (`sp_vendor_net_ppm`)

- **Cost breakdown** — Revenue minus COGS, shipping costs, and other costs — where am I losing margin?
- **Margin trends** — Is my overall net PPM improving or declining over time?

### Vendor Cross-Report Insights

- **Low stock + high traffic** — ASINs with low weeks of cover but high glance views. Urgent replenishment signal.
- **High returns + declining margin** — ASINs where returns are eating into profitability.
- **Forecast gap** — ASINs where Amazon's forecast exceeds current sellable on-hand inventory.
